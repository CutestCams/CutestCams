- 👋 Hi, I’m @CutestCams, a coding student wanting/willing to learn how to code properly.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning on how to draw and animate, because I want to make a passion project of my own someday that I want others to enjoy too (but mainly cause my art and animating skills suck) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on how the basic mechanics of how a game should work and how not to write crappy chracters (smth that YandereDev can't do)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her They/Them
- ⚡ Fun facts about me:
  Cats and owls are my fav animals,
  I think Yandere Simulator is a shitty game (and YandereDev is one of the worst game developers to ever exist),
  I like collecting gemstones and rocks sometimes,
  Gardevoir is my fav Pokemon (I'm not one of those horny morons, fuck you if you think that)
  and Espeon and Umbreon are my fav eeveelutions.
